# Archived Forecasts for Portal Project Forecasting

These are archived forecasts for Portal Project Forecasting. The main repository
for this research
is
[github.com/weecology/portalPredictions](github.com/weecology/portalPredictions).

Older files are named based on the date the forecasts were made, whether they
are forecasts or hindcasts, and whether they were made for the entire study site
or just the control plots. E.g.,

```
2017-06-27AllForecasts.csv
```

Newer files leave out the control vs. entire study site information (since it is
present in the table itself). E.g.,

```
2018-01-19forecasts.csv
```

Information on how well the models fit the training data are also included in a
paired file with `_model_aic` added to the filename.
